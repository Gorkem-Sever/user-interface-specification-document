        Type: Checkbox
        Default State: Checked
        Action: If checked, the table will hide any users with the Enabled status set to false. Unchecking the box will display both enabled and disabled users.
    "Save User Button:
        Type: Button
        Action: Saves the user details. If a new user is being added, this creates a new record. If an existing user is being updated, it updates the record.

3. Page Behavior
3.1. On Page Load:

    The User List Table will display a list of all enabled users.
    The Hide Disabled User checkbox will be checked by default.
    The New User Form will be empty.

3.2. When "Hide Disabled User" Checkbox is Toggled:

    Filling in the form and clicking Save User creates a new user in the system, and the table is updated to reflect the new user.

3.4. Editing an Existing User:

    When a row in the User List Table is clicked, the corresponding user’s data is populated in the New User Form.

3.5. Error Handling:

    If the Username or Email fields are not unique, the system should display an error message to the user when attempting to save.
